Rizety Public Availability License - v0.2

Copyright (c) 2020 - Rizety

Everyone is permitted to copy verbatim copies of this license, however modification is prohibited.

-- Preface --
This license is designed to protect publicly available property and/or software (the Product). This license is designed to allow 
modification and public availability of the Product, however allowing the proprietor (the Owner) to keep large control over use of 
the Product, and how it is distributed.

-- Main --
[Section A]
The Product belongs to the Owner. However, the Product is free (as in beer) to whoever would like a copy (the User), and free (as 
in freedom) to to whoever would like to modify it (the Modifier) as long as the Modifier does so in a non-commercial manner. The
Modifier is also permitted to publicly release the source of modified versions of the Product as long as it is obtainable (a)
without obtaining a copy, (b) is free of charge, or (c) is used to contribute to development progress of the Owner.

[Section B]
There are exceptions to these terms. If the Modifier makes such a transformative change to the Product, to the point where it is
unrecognizable as the original Product, and the Product does not infringe on the Owner's rights, it is free to be a separate
product, and released under it's own license and it's own terms.

[Section C]
Furthermore, if the Modifier modifies the Product, where the terms of Section B do not apply, and redistributes it with explicit 
permission from the Owner, or with the stated intent to give a proceedings cut of 45% to the Owner, the Modifier is free to 
redistribute modified copies of the Product.

[Section D]
If the terms are violated in the case that the Modifier has redistributed non-transformative modified versions of the Product,
then the Modifier and the Owner are to (a) negotiate a deal by the terms of Section C, (b) take it to court, or (c) deal with
it in an informal, out-of-court, manner.
